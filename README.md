# PCA9685 Robotic Arm Motion Sequence

This project drives a 6-DOF robotic arm using an Arduino and the Adafruit PCA9685 PWM servo driver.  
The sketch executes a predefined, smooth multi-stage motion sequence by incrementally updating servo positions over time.

The code is structured around six tracked servo channels:

- **pos0** – Wrist rotation  
- **pos1** – Elbow  
- **pos2** – Wrist tilt  
- **pos3** – Hand open/close  
- **pos4** – Shoulder  
- **pos5** – Base rotation  

All movements are generated by modifying these position variables and sending PWM values to the PCA9685 at **50 Hz**.

## Hardware Overview

**Components used:**
- Arduino (Uno, Nano, or compatible)
- Adafruit PCA9685 16-channel PWM driver (I²C)
- 6 hobby servos (SG90, MG996R, or other)
- External servo power supply (≥5V, high-current capable)
- Common ground between power supply, PCA9685, and Arduino

**Servo wiring:**
- PCA9685 channel 0 → Wrist  
- PCA9685 channel 1 → Elbow  
- PCA9685 channel 2 → Tilt  
- PCA9685 channel 3 → Hand  
- PCA9685 channel 4 → Shoulder  
- PCA9685 channel 5 → Base
